The **SI_notebook.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook contains the steps and procedures to reproduce the key findings of our paper (in press).
The notebook doesn't reproduce *all* the results published in the paper, however it provides almost all tools for anyone interested in doing similar studies, mostly in forms of functions.
We will keep updating it with new implementations as soon as we have them.

The Boolean models and supporting files are included in the repository. 

The necessary python packages to run the notebook:<br>
numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (optional)<br>

BooleanNet - https://github.com/ialbert/booleannet <br>
NetworkX - https://networkx.github.io/

Every other function used in the notebook is defined "in house". <br>

Comments and suggestions are welcome!
